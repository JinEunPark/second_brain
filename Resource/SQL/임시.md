```sql
set @total_user := 0;
select @total_user:= count(*)
from user_info u
where year(u.joined) = 2021;

select 
    year(o.sales_date) as year, 
    month(o.sales_date) as month, 
    count(distinct o.user_id) as puchased_users, 
    round(count(distinct o.user_id)/@total_user,1) as puchased_ratio
    
from online_sale o
join user_info u on u.user_id = o.user_id
where year(u.joined) = 2021
group by year,month;
```


### 지역 변수 
~~~sql
set @total_user := 0;
select @total_user:= count(*)
from user_info u
where year(u.joined) = 2021;
~~~

지역 변수를 만들어서 2021 년에 가입한 총 user 의 수를 구했다

그리고 이후에 

```sql
select 
    year(o.sales_date) as year, 
    month(o.sales_date) as month, 
    count(distinct o.user_id) as puchased_users, 
    round(count(distinct o.user_id)/@total_user,1) as puchased_ratio
    
from online_sale o
join user_info u on u.user_id = o.user_id
where year(u.joined) = 2021
group by year,month;
```
